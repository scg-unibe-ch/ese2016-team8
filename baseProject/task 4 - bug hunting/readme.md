# Task 4: Crash your opponents

## Assignment

For the coming week, your team will be assigned a project from another team. You need to find at least three bugs in their project and report them using the issue tracker of that project. These bugs should be non-trivial. Typos, alignments, UI design flaws do not count.

#### How?

* Write test cases that demonstrate the bug.
* Inspect the code.
* Try the website yourselves exhaustively until you crash it or get wrong results.
* Use your knowledge about the bugs in your own code to reveal other's bugs.

#### What to report?

Bug reports should contain all the necessary information needed to reproduce the bug. Ideally, you should include as many of the following:

* Failing test cases
* Steps to reproduce the bug
* Stack traces
* Expected and observed behavior (what's wrong)
* The reason behind the bug (if you know)
* The location of the bug (if you know)

#### Team assignments:

* Team 1 tests the project of team 4
* Team 4 tests the project of team 7
* Team 7 tests the project of team 1
* Team 2 tests the project of team 5
* Team 5 tests the project of team 8
* Team 8 tests the project of team 2
* Team 3 tests the project of team 6
* Team 6 tests the project of team 9
* Team 9 tests the project of team 3
