Team 8 and Claudio, 26.10.2016

Input of Claudio aka Customer: 
General things:
--> Issuetracker: Use the whoole SCRUM-Issuetracker, by splitting up the single task into several smaller tasks. Good for us on the level of organization but also for the later evaluation.
--> Descripe the Issuetracker more positive and split it further up, because at the moment the subjects are too big.
--> Also split up the features furtherly.

Progress of the asked features defined in 2nd Discussion:
i) Premium: Make a update for premium, a request to pay for the users, and also automatic updates after for premium.
--> A red star on the side of the username for the momentual premium status.
ii) Auction: Default no name, under-bidding not possible, link to the user profile.
--> Remove the link to the highest bidder, only show his name but no further information.

TODO:
--> What happens once a new offer has been placed? (Send an E-Mail to the user being overbid). see Issue #7 at https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2016-team8/issues/7 
--> Remove roommates once a new offer has been placed. see Issue #8 https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2016-team8/issues/8

--> Star for Premiumuser. see Issue #10 https://github.com/scg-unibe-ch/ese2016-team8/issues/10
--> Modernize design: Either start implementing or create nice Mock-ups on paper for the customer.
