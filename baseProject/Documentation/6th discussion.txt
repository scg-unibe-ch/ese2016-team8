Input from customers:
- Whether we've been able to fix the bugs.
- Whether we've been able to find bugs and write tests.

Input from developers:
- If pull requests haven't been accepted, does this have to influence us. --> No.
- TrumpFindr is widely spread and appreciated by the customer.
- Google Maps integration is being called "gedige".

Concerning the usability tests:
- 1 Test:
-- Having an item already bookmarkred, going to rent an object. 
-- Is going to search for bookmarked lists.
--- Doesn't find the bookmarked lists. Has found it.
-- Clicks on a object to rent
-- Has clicked to rent it
-- Has written an email to the provider

-- Checks whether the email has been sent.

-2 Test:
-- Being the most-bidding user.
-- Getting overbid
--- Problems with the linking to get to the auction
-- Going to overbid again
-- Overbids again
--- Tried to overbid with a negative value, but failed miserably. 
-- Wins the auction.
--- Checks for the message and has gotten both messages.

-3. Test:
-- Logged in at the main page, and place an offer.
-- Place an ad for Zürich, Smokers and Garage and creative values.
--- Places it with some creative values.
