Preparation for our first customer meeting in order to clarify given specification.
The structure will be as follow:

### Our company has a website for the real estate market. This website has the following features:

 * Users can place an ad for advertising a room in a shared apartment
> Can you specify what you mean by can, no pre-knowledge necessary, so kind of a guided tour in order to place the ad.
>
> By shared apartment, would the german equivalent be "Wohngemeinschaft"?

 * Users can search for relevant ads in a specific area
> What do you mean with specific area. I.E. Bern and 10 km around it? Or just a city with surrounding zip code (agglomerations)?

* Users can get exhaustive information about a room (e.g. pictures, location, roommate profiles, ..)
> Should certain information only be accessible when certain criteria are met i.e. only show someones phone number or e-mail address when a verified user is checking?
>
> Or make everything visible to everyone?
>
> Do pictures have to meet certain criteria? In terms of quality? Off-topic?

* Users can quickly send an enquiry to the ad placer
> What does quickly mean? Without any further help? Or under a certain time limit?
>
> Does the user need to fulfill criteria in order to be allowed to send an enquiry?

* Users can conveniently manage enquiries and organize on-site visits
> Can you explain further what you mean by conveniently manage enquiries? Would you like some sort of inbox where enquiries are shown?
>
> Organize on-site visits? What do you mean by that? That the provider is shown who visited his profile?

* Users can manage scheduled visits
> Do you want to force the provider to give already scheduled visit times in order to being able to place an ad or is it optional?

* Users can compile a list of the most promising candidates
> Do you mean that users can chose from candidates which one they want to "keep" and whom they already want to say no to?
>
> What criteria is being used in order to determine promising? Is this the users choice or do we have to offer more than the candidate's profile?

* Users can bookmark interesting ads
> So does every user get a list of bookmarked ads where he can add those interesting ads to?
>
> Should the bookmark-list also be searchable, or in other words does this list need to be dynamic or do you just want a plain list?

* Users can subscribe to alerts to be informed about relevant ads
> Relevant ads, how are those chosen? Does the user i.e. say if an ad in Bern for less than 1'500.- is placed, I want to get informed? Which information should be choosable as a criteria?
>
> How should the user be alerted? Through e-mail?

* A user can put an ad to sell properties directly or through an auction.


* A user can search for properties for sale similarly to the search form for properties for rent
> Please specify: What do you want it to look like? Exactly the same, except the title?

* A user can create search alerts which notify him about new ads corresponding the search criteria.
> How does this differ from 'Users can subscribe to alerts to be informed about relevant ads'?
>
> What things are important enough to notify the user? When the ad's object has been sold? 30 minute of bidding time remaining?

* Extend the search capabilities to cover more filter criteria
> Which criteria did you have in mind? Additional to the existing?

* Different user roles: Premium and Normal
> We will identify premium users by their e-mail address, so therefore they aren't allowed to change it without noticing us before, just you know.

* Premium users: get alerts and results early
> Compare question below

* Normal users get the results a bit late
> What does early and a bit late mean? Should we implement a timer, which just waits for 3 seconds when a normal user tries to access something? Same for the alerts?
> What did you have in mind?

* The adds of premium user are a bit higher in the result list
> 'A bit higher'.
> tfw
> Does a bit higher mean, premium user's ad will always be listed on top, or more mixed, or what did you have in mind?
