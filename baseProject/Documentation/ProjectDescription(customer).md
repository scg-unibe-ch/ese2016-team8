### Our company has a website for the real estate market. This website has the following features:

- Users can place an ad for advertising a room in a shared apartment
- Users can search for relevant ads in a specific area
- Users can get exhaustive information about a room (e.g. pictures, location, roommate profiles, ..)
- Users can quickly send an enquiry to the ad placer
- Users can conveniently manage enquiries and organize on-site visits
- Users can manage scheduled visits
- Users can compile a list of the most promising candidates
- Users can bookmark interesting ads
- Users can subscribe to alerts to be informed about relevant ads
- And so on ...

##### Following the success of our company, we need to expand our market to buying, selling, and renting properties of all types, not only apartments or rooms. Also the UI of the website looks and feels old style and needs to be refurbished into a more elegant and modern shape.


To be more specific, the new requirements include:

- A user can put an ad to sell properties directly or through an auction.
- A user can search for properties for sale similarly to the search form for properties for rent
- A user can create search alerts which notify him about new ads corresponding the search criteria.

Extend the search capabilities to cover more filter criteria
Different user roles: Premium and Normal
Premium users: get alerts and results early
Normal users get the results a bit late
The adds of premium user are a bit higher in the result list
