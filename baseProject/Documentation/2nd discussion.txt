Team 8 and Claudio, 19.10.2016

Customer Input:
SRS is okay, no further security mechanisms are necessary. Nevertheless access to the database should still only happen through controllers, as defined by the TA. Further no local files, but maybe log files. Also don't write in other folders).

--> We need to write down our intentions concering the safety on the SRS.

--> If the user sets the radius to 0km, only ads with the same zip code should be shown. Else the radius should be shown, maybe default value of radius to 0km.

--> Remove 'admin' from the 'enum' gender.

--> Restructure 'room', 'studio', 'house' into an enum rather than using string parsing.

--> Keep on doing Start/ Backlog and/or discussions. So just keep a way of documentation.

Next week:
Auction: description 'sattelfest' written into the SRS. Try that everything is always as clear as possible, and try to show what and how something is happening.
--> Begin to inplement auction. If you fail to implement a working version, make a interface on paper, in order to give the customer the possibility to comment about what and how things should be.

---> Create a piazza post about the criterais (is refactoring or new functionality more important)
