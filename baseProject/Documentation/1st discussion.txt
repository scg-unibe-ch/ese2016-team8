1st discussion:

Search for an ad:
3rd and 4th categories for rooms resp. houses. Also there should be the additional possibility of either buying or renting these objects.

Auctions: The initial price and the end date are needed to in order to create an action, keep the rest as easy as possible. Also concering the concurrent part, the one bidding the most once the time runs out will be the winner .

Second tier importance: Premium
Somewhere on the page should be a button where a user can ask to get premium. Afterwards a facture will be sent and be shown as pending in the user profile.
1. Premium offers, so offers created by premium users, should be shown first, and secondly 'normal' offers. Later on there might also come further criterias.
2. Delay: Periodicly the saved search criterias should be applied and a summary should be sent to the (premium only) user.

We need to keep on using Spring, but if we need some bigger libraries, we should first confront the customer and ask him.
