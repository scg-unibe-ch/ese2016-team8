# Task5: Usability Test Design

## Summary

For next week, you are going to design usability tests and run them by your customer during the meeting. As you learned in the lecture, a usability test is a use case scenario that exercises a certain feature of the application. The task should be clear and the success criteria should be explicit. For instance: "search for an apartment" is not a good task. A better version is: "You are willing to pay up to 2000 CHF per month for a rent and you want to live in the city of Bern. Find an apartment that fits you".

Make sure to design your tasks to take no more than 30 minutes.

## Assignment:

    Fix the bugs reported by your reviewers.
    Make sure your application is clean from any major bugs. Nothing is worse for usability than crashing application :)
    Create a directory in your project directory called "usability". Write down your usability tasks in a document called "scenarios" under the "usability" directory.
